# Pharma Project

This is a pharmaceutical-related project that includes both web components and Python scripts for data processing and analysis.

## How to Run

To run the main Python script, execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Test

To run the tests, execute:
```bash
pytest test_main.py
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed before running the scripts. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it first:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

Then install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
